<h2> This is my Trimester 2 Individual Review </h2>

<h3> Project Overview: </h3>

Our CPT project was focused on creating a casino simulator, for the educational purpose to teach students and others that gambling can lead to addiction and harmful behavior. Our project implemented different games made individually by each person, such as slot machines, car racing, dice betting, and black jack. 

<h3> My Features </h3>

<ul> Dice Game: This user-friendly game has several features that includes pictrues, sound, currency balance, and more. The application of the "math.random" code allowed me to return random integers, which created the randomizer sequence for the dice game. </ul>

<li> Pictures: I was able to create a friendly enviorment by putting pictures in the background of a casino dice game, and a dice for visual effects. These were made soley for the purpose of user entertainment, to attract the user to want to play some of the other games aswell. </li>
<br>

<li> Sound: I added a dice rolling sound when the user rolls the dice, which is just for the user's entertainent. With the casino we wanted to create a friendly simulator that attracts the user, but will make them addicted to the "gamble high".</li>
<br>

<li> Currency Balance: The user starts off with $150, and is able to spend their currency freely throughout the casino sim. In my dice game, if the user is able to land the number that they chose, they will double the amount of money they placed a bet on. Through the storage of the backend and SQLite Database, the user is able to store their currency which is associasted to their account (user and login). This means that they can go from game to game, and maintain the same currency balance, wheter they lose or gain money. </li>
<br>

<li> Rigged feature: The main feature/lesson learned that our project has implemented is that most all of the games in our simulator were rigged. For example, while users may be tempted to "double" their money if they win their bet on the dice game, the chances of winning is (1/6), which is only a 16% chance. This feature is used to take our project up a step from simply being a game to a project that has an impact on people's perspectives of gambling and it's negatives. When the user runs out of money to spend, a screen shares with them about data of gambling, and the negatives of gambling.
