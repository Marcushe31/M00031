<h2> This is my Trimester 2 Individual Review </h2>

<h3> Project Overview: </h3>

Our CPT project was focused on creating a casino simulator, for the educational purpose to teach students and others that gambling can lead to addiction and harmful behavior. Our project implemented different games made individually by each person, such as slot machines, car racing, dice betting, and black jack. 

<h3> My Features </h3>

<ul> Dice Game: This user-friendly game has several features that includes animation, sound, currency balance, and more. The application of the "math.random" code allowed me to return random integers, which created the randomizer sequence for the dice game.
